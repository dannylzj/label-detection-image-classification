# Label detection using Image Classification

## Project Description

The dataset I have worked on are actual images collected from my Project Sponsor. Each image consists of a label printed on a particular type steel stock (steel plate, angle bar or bulb flat).

The goal of this project is to train a model to automatically classify these labels accurately into 3 classes:
1) Heat Number
2) Dimension
3) Grade

By using this model, steel stock can be accurately classified without the need for manual identification. An OCR engine will then be incorporated into the pipeline to automatically recognize the text on the labels to digitize it into a .csv file for future implementation. This will allow automated material identification upon delivery to the yard.

## Dataset Description

Images.zip (106MB) - These images have been collected and labelled using [SuperAnnotate](https://superannotate.com/). A copy can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1IMp44zOlgXym914SHiDkuRCc2MObeU/view?usp=sharing)
annotations.json - File generated by SuperAnnotate containing image details and bounding box coordinates
classes.json - File generated by SuperAnnotate containing class labels

After uncompressing the images, ./Images/ contain 213 raw images taken using a mobile phone camera.

The image classification pipeline can be viewed [here]().
